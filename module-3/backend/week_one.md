## Week One - Module 3 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week (which is a TON!). 

Note: When you're done, submit a PR. 

1. What is `json` and why is it important?
  * JSON stands for Java Script Object notation, which is a data format, easy to read and write for us and machines. It's important because it bridges that gap between humans and machine in how to transpose data.

2. What's the difference between `joins` and `includes` in ActiveRecord?
  * Joins loads all records of tables "joined" but doesn't allow access to the attributes without performing an additional query. Includes gives us the ability to access attributes of the joined model without permorfing additional queries.

3. What's an API?
  * API stands for Application Program Interface, which provides data to other users to consume.

4. How do we test an internal API (in general)?
  * We test its response(status code).

5. What are two different ways to customize your `json`?
  * JSON can be customized using a serilizer or it can be change using jbuilder, both have their advantages and disadvanateges.
